# Hashing

I went looking for a good visualization of Cryptographic Hash functions, and couldn't find any designed for lay people.
So I decided to build one.

## Having fun with Web Components and Cryptographic Hashes

I have a wide set of interests in Computer Science, Cryptography, Human Factors, and Data Visualization.   A couple
months ago I was fiddling around with BitCoin, and was surprised that the GPU implementations were now only modestly
faster than the CPU implementations.  So I wanted a better 'picture' of how SHA-2 works so I would understand why it
couldn't be parallelized more effectively.

I've used digests fairly extensively in my work.  I'm familiar with the implementations, and diagrams for computer
engineers are easy to find.  But show me a data flow diagram that I could show to teach digests?  Not so easy.  So here
I am, trying it out.

I also needed a better grasp on Web Components for a couple of upcoming projects, so why not throw that in too?
