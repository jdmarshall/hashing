            <p>
                There are reams of literature on what makes a good cryptographic hash.  Every ten years or so we have a
                competition to pick some new ones. You may have seen pseudocode.  You may have seen diagrams of the inner
                workings.  Maybe you can even read and understand the code. But have you ever seen a good illustration of how
                they work?  I don't think I have.
            </p>

            <p>
                Recently I was toying around with Bitcoin.  I understood pretty quickly why CPU and GPU miners were no longer
                competetive with custom hardware, but what I couldn't figure out is why GPU miners weren't much faster than CPU
                miners (at least not on my hardware).
            </p>

            <p>
                I wanted visuals, something a bit more accessible, like <a href="http://gizmodo.com/mining-bitcoin-with-pencil-and-paper-1640353309">mining bitcoin with pencil and paper</a>,
                but with less talking and more pictures.  Hopefully other people find this interesting too.

                If you need a refresher in hashes, I've made a <a href="hashes.html">modest attempt</a>.  For a rundown of the
                visualization I've selected, see my <a href="dataviz.html">full explanation</a> or the sidebar.

                A rectangle represents 4 bits (one hexadecimal digit). A color bar represents a 1 bit.  A green bar 
                indicates a one bit difference.  Hover over a column for the hex value.

            <h3>The Plan</h3>

            <p>
                One of the things you learn about data visualization is that often the key is not <em>how</em> you display the
                data, but what data you choose to display.  If I showed you how a message travels through the 64 rounds of
                mathematical calculations involved in creating a SHA-2 hash of a short message, I'd leave you bored, confused,
                or possibly angry.  Instead I'm going to demonstrate how minor changes to the input affect the outcome of the
                hash.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="main">
            <h3>Displaying hashing 'rounds'</h3>
            <p>
                Most hash algorithms achieve their 'strength' by repeating a simple algorithm enough times that it is
                unimaginable that anyone could reverse or cheat the entire operation.  This loop count is sometimes called
                'rounds'.  Before the first round a little bit of logic may run, but the main part of the algorithm is often
                a separate operation, as is the code for emitting the final value.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is the hash value for "I owe you $10" if you do 0 (zero) rounds of SHA-2:
            </p>

            <hash-rounds input="I owe you $10" rounds="0"></hash-rounds>

            <p>
                This is the hash value for "I owe you $10" if you do 1 (one) rounds of SHA-2:
            </p>

            <hash-rounds input="I owe you $10" rounds="1"></hash-rounds>

            <p>
                Which changes almost half the bits:
            </p>

            <binary-pattern bits="0xd413ccce76cf5d0a78dde6e44a9fea74a21ca4fe360ad1183f07b356b7c19a32"
                            versus="0xaf32de2b257194ecf7d6a1f7e1bee8ac32f6a498ec13bb0bba8942377b64a6c4"></binary-pattern>

                <h3>'Rounds' in SHA-2</h3>
                <img src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/SHA-2.svg/320px-SHA-2.svg.png"/>
                <caption>Wikipedia's SHA-2 'Diagram' exhibits the round behavior</caption>
            </aside>
            <p>
                The fact is, any similarity between bits in round 1 and round 2 are purely coincidental, because each round of
                the hash algorithm rearranges all of the bits.  Like a lot of hashes, each round moves the data around.  In
                SHA-2 a round involves reordering the bits in each slot and <em>then</em> moving each slot one position to the
                right. This means comparing one round to the next is comparing apples and oranges.  So what <em>can</em> we
                compare?
            </p>

            <p>
                Instead we should compare two similar messages to each other:
            </p>

            <hash-rounds input="I owe you $10" versus="I owe you $50" rounds="3" ></hash-rounds>

            <p>
                That's "I owe you $10" versus "I owe you $50" at 3 rounds.  There's only two bits difference between them, and
                only one bit of difference in the messages.  But by round 10:
            </p>

            <hash-rounds input="I owe you $10" versus="I owe you $50" rounds="10" complete="true"></hash-rounds>

            <p>
                And the full hash, after only changing the tens digit in the quantity owed, ends up as:
            </p>

            <hash-rounds input="I owe you $10" versus="I owe you $50" rounds="64"></hash-rounds>        
        
            <h4>Tamper Resistance/Evidence</h4>
            <p>
                This is precisely the sort of behavior one looks for in a cryptographic hash: tamper resistance.  If 
                anyone changes anything (on accident or on purpose), we want to know before we do anything rash with the
                wrong information.  This is also why so many people use hashes for file downloads.  It lets you know if 
                something went wrong with the transfer, and if you can trust the hash (most sites do NOT give you any 
                reason to trust the hash, however) then you know that you got the complete version of the file you 
                expected.
            </p>
            <p>
                Several times in my career, I've encountered a popular piece of software that was released with a bug, 
                and then silently updated almost immediately.  In the cases I am aware of this happening it is because
                we had several people who were experiencing a bug and nobody else could recreate it.  It turned out in
                two of those situations that despite us all having downloading 2.5.1 of the application, only the people
                who downloaded it first had the problem, and their installers had a different hash than the rest of us.  
                After having spent man-days diagnosing the problem, it's frustrating for the answer to be 'uninstall and
                download it again' but at least we had our answer.

                This code was inspired in part by an article on
                <a href="http://gizmodo.com/mining-bitcoin-with-pencil-and-paper-1640353309">mining bitcoin with pencil and paper</a>,
                and the accompanying video.  But none of this would have been possible without my lifelong appreciation of the
                works of Bruce Schneier (cryptographer and security pundit) and Edward Tufte (maestro of data visualization).

                Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/chrisveness">Chris Veness</a> for his concise implementation of
                SHA-256 in Javascript, which with a few tweaks let me extract the intermediate states without having to
                roll a SHA-256 implementation myself.
