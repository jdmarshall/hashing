    <h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>

    <p>
        There are reams of literature on what makes a good cryptographic hash.  Every ten years or so we have a
        competition to pick some new ones. You may have seen pseudocode.  You may have seen diagrams of the inner
        workings.  Maybe you can even read and understand the code. But have you ever seen a good illustration of how
        they work?  I don't think I have.
    </p>

    <p>
        Recently I was toying around with Bitcoin.  I understood pretty quickly why CPU and GPU miners were no longer
        competetive with custom hardware, but what I couldn't figure out is why GPU miners weren't much faster than CPU
        miners (at least not on my hardware).
    </p>

    <p>
        I wanted visuals, something a bit more accessible, like <a href="http://gizmodo.com/mining-bitcoin-with-pencil-and-paper-1640353309">mining bitcoin with pencil and paper</a>,
        but with less talking and more pictures.  What I'd like to show, among other things, is how a small change to
        the input changes the output drastically.
    </p>

    <p>If you need a refresher in hashes, I've made a <a href="hashes.html">modest attempt</a></p>

    <h3 id="example">The Language</h3>

    <div>
        <p>
            The SHA family of hashes works mostly with 32 bit numbers.  This is how we will represent a 32 bit number in
            these examples.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a representation of '0xffffffff' or 'all bits are set':
        </p>

        <binary-pattern bits="0xffffffff"></binary-pattern>

        <p>
            You might notice that there are 8 little boxes.  We've grouped bits into sets of 4, a common strategy
            (otherwise known as hexadecimal or just 'hex' if you're in a hurry) for dealing with lots binary data.
        </p>

        <p>
            And this is how we'll represent '0xaaaaaaaa', otherwise known as 'all even bits are set'.
        </p>

        <binary-pattern bits="0xaaaaaaaa"></binary-pattern>

        <p>
            And here are 64 bits, one with each hex value (0x0123456789abcdef).
        </p>

        <binary-pattern bits="0x0123456789abcdef"></binary-pattern>
    </div>

    <h3 id="the-plan">The Plan</h3>
    <p>
        Okay, this all sounds pretty good, but SHA-2 hashes are pretty big, and for some versions the internal data is
        twice that big.  This is a SHA-256 hash:
    </p>
    <binary-pattern bits="0x0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef"></binary-pattern>

    <p>
        We're not trying to invent a new graphical representation of hashes here.  At any rate, if I put two of
        these next to each other you'd be hard pressed to tell them apart.  This also isn't bar codes for
        cryptographers.  Instead, we're trying to visualize the hashing lifecycle.  For our purposes, instead of using
        these colored bars to represent a hash, we're going to use them to represent the difference between two hashes.
    </p>
    <p>
        In other words, a colored bar means the bit changed.

        This code was inspired in part by an article on
        <a href="http://gizmodo.com/mining-bitcoin-with-pencil-and-paper-1640353309">mining bitcoin with pencil and paper</a>,
        and the accompanying video.  But none of this would have been possible without my lifelong appreciation of the
        works of Bruce Schneier (cryptographer and security pundit) and Edward Tufte (maestro of data visualization).
