            <p>
                There are reams of literature on what makes a good cryptographic hash.  Every ten years or so we have a
                competition to pick some new ones. You may have seen pseudocode.  You may have seen diagrams of the inner
                workings.  Maybe you can even read and understand the code. But have you ever seen a good illustration of how
                they work?  I don't think I have.
            </p>

            <p>
                Recently I was toying around with Bitcoin.  I understood pretty quickly why CPU and GPU miners were no longer
                competetive with custom hardware, but what I couldn't figure out is why GPU miners weren't much faster than CPU
                miners (at least not on my hardware).
            </p>

            <p>
                I wanted visuals, something a bit more accessible, like <a href="http://gizmodo.com/mining-bitcoin-with-pencil-and-paper-1640353309">mining bitcoin with pencil and paper</a>,
                but with less talking and more pictures.  Hopefully other people find this interesting too.

                If you need a refresher in hashes, I've made a <a href="hashes.html">modest attempt</a>.  For a rundown of the
                visualization I've selected, see my <a href="dataviz.html">full explanation</a> or the sidebar.

                A rectangle represents 4 bits (one hexadecimal digit). A color bar represents a 1 bit. Hover over a
                column for the hex value.

            <h3>The Plan</h3>

            <p>
                One of the things you learn about data visualization is that often the key is not <em>how</em> you display the
                data, but what data you choose to display.  If I showed you how a message travels through the 64 rounds of
                mathematical calculations involved in creating a SHA-2 hash of a short message, I'd leave you bored, confused,
                or possibly angry.  Instead I'm going to demonstrate how minor changes to the input affect the outcome of the
                hash.

                This code was inspired in part by an article on
                <a href="http://gizmodo.com/mining-bitcoin-with-pencil-and-paper-1640353309">mining bitcoin with pencil and paper</a>,
                and the accompanying video.  But none of this would have been possible without my lifelong appreciation of the
                works of Bruce Schneier (cryptographer and security pundit) and Edward Tufte (maestro of data visualization).
