    <h1 id="hashes">What's a Cryptographic Hash?</h1>
</section>

<section class="main-content">
    <h2 id="intro">Hashes in a nutshell</h2>

    <p>
        We use hashes relatively frequently in programming, although often you aren't even aware of it.  If you attended
        a CS degree they probably talked about them quite a bit. With a normal hash, you take some sort of data and
        turn it into a short number.  That's a hash.  In doing this operation, you make reasonable attempts to insure
        that very few 'interesting' values result in the same hash, known as a Hash Collision.  There is a ton of
        literature on the topic, but sadly in practice we haven't done a very good job of achieving it, and in fact
        there's now a whole class of Denial of Service attacks against web servers based on this observation.
    </p>

    <p>
        When the chips are down and you really truly need to make sure that no two legal inputs result in the same
        output, we turn to Cryptographic Hashes.
    </p>

    <h2>Cryptographic Hashes</h2>

    <p>
        A lot more effort goes into generating a cryptographic hash, but the payoff is that they are useful for a great
        many things we would never trust a regular hash to do, because they offer certain guarantees that allow us to
        trust them.  When that trust begins to break down (faster computers, cryptographic research, etc), we find a new
        hash and keep using them.
    </p>
    <h3>Larger space</h3>
    <p>
        A cryptographic hash generally takes a piece of data and gives you back a much longer number.  By the Pigeonhole
        Principle, how many distinct values you can represent is limited by the number of representations you have.
        Since most hashes, cryptographic or otherwise, guarantee that all output states are possible, it follows that a
        longer hash has fewer collisions.
    </p>

    <h3>Mixing</h3>

    <p>
        But a larger space isn't much of a guarantee, if two nearly identical messages result in the same output.
        There's a big difference between "I owe you $10" and "I owe you $50".  It's not enough for hashes to just
        create a number.  Similar inputs must result in extremely different outputs, and we grade hashes by how much
        a new value 'perturbs' or 'mixes up' the output.  The mixing means that collisions don't generally happen by
        accident, and are nearly impossible to cause to happen on purpose.
    </p>

    <p>I owe you $10</p>

    <binary-pattern bits="0x9ccaf59bc1175fa65ff793246eb342a2ef91614c4d038f186f14a39862da031e"></binary-pattern>

    <p>I owe you $50</p>

    <binary-pattern bits="0x7bb6318685092bc9d5dad0e0562e260f524f51e13ab38ba9e6dc6b95f22a474c"></binary-pattern>

    <p>The difference between these two hashes is:</p>

    <binary-pattern bits="0x9ccaf59bc1175fa65ff793246eb342a2ef91614c4d038f186f14a39862da031e"
            versus="0x7bb6318685092bc9d5dad0e0562e260f524f51e13ab38ba9e6dc6b95f22a474c"></binary-pattern>

    <p>That's a one bit difference in the input, and almost half of the bits were changed.  All due to mixing</p>

    <p>
        For mixing to be done properly, it must posses one more quality.  For any message, I have a hash.  By adding
        onto that message, I should be able to generate any other possible hash.  To put this another way, if Mixing is
        working properly, the algorithm should never get 'stuck in a rut'.  This means that changing a small part of a
        very long message is just as hard as changing a short message, because the qualities of the hash don't degrade
        with any particular inputs.
    </p>

    <h4>Seeding</h4>
    <p>
        As part of the mixing process, we also want short messages to exhibit this behavior (there's a second reason
        for this, which we'll go into shortly) as soon as possible.  Since part of the mixing function often involves
        looking at how many ones and zeroes are in the output, starting with '0' would make those functions 'start'
        slowly.  To fight that we use seeds, otherwise known as Magic Numbers.
    </p>

    <p>
        For instance, this is the SHA-256 hash when the input is zero bytes:
    </p>

    <binary-pattern bits="0xe3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855"></binary-pattern>

    <p>
        And this is the SHA-256 hash for one whitespace character:
    </p>

    <binary-pattern bits="0xe16f1596201850fd4a63680b27f603cb64e67176159be3d8ed78a4403fdb1700"></binary-pattern>

    <p>And here is the difference between these two hashes.  As you can see, quite a few bits have flipped:</p>

    <binary-pattern
            bits="0xe3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855"
            versus="0xe16f1596201850fd4a63680b27f603cb64e67176159be3d8ed78a4403fdb1700"
            ></binary-pattern>

    <p>
        Due to the structure of the algorithm, there is strong mixing even with a small input.
    </p>

    <p>
        Magic numbers are a tricky thing though.  Cryptographers are naturally paranoid, and if someone like NIST or the
        NSA comes to you and says "trust us" they try not to (and we have a recent example when it turned out they were
        lying).  So most hashes use a magic number that is based on some simple mathematical progression, based on
        something like <code>e</code>, &pi;, fibonacci numbers, or primes.  For Sha-2, you start with the decimal part
        of the square and cube roots of the first 8 prime numbers.
