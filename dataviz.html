    <h3>Displaying binary data</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            The SHA family of hashes works mostly with 32 bit numbers.  This is how we will represent a 32 bit number in
            these examples.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a representation of '0xffffffff' or 'all bits are set':
        </p>

        <binary-pattern class="example" bits="0xffffffff"></binary-pattern>

        <p>
            You might notice that there are 8 little boxes.  We've grouped bits into sets of 4, a common strategy
            (otherwise known as hexadecimal or just 'hex' if you're in a hurry) for dealing with lots binary data.
        </p>

        <p>
            And this is how we'll represent '0xaaaaaaaa', otherwise known as 'all even bits are set'.
        </p>

        <binary-pattern class="example" bits="0xaaaaaaaa"></binary-pattern>

        <p>
            And here are 64 bits, one with each hex value (0x0123456789abcdef).
        </p>

        <binary-pattern class="example" bits="0x0123456789abcdef"></binary-pattern>
    </div>

    <p>
        Okay, this all sounds pretty good, but SHA-2 hashes are pretty big, and for some versions the internal data is
        twice that big.  This is a SHA-256 hash:
    </p>
    <binary-pattern bits="0x7bb6318685092bc9d5dad0e0562e260f524f51e13ab38ba9e6dc6b95f22a474c"></binary-pattern>

    <p>
        We're not really trying to invent a new graphical representation of hashes here.  At any rate, if I put two of
        these next to each other you'd be hard pressed to tell them apart.  This also isn't bar codes for
        cryptographers.  Instead, we're trying to visualize the hashing lifecycle.  For our purposes, instead of using
        these colored bars to represent a hash, we're going to use them to represent the difference between two hashes.
    </p>
    <p>
        In other words, green colored bar means the bit changed.
    </p>

    <binary-pattern bits="0x9ccaf59bc1175fa65ff793246eb342a2ef91614c4d038f186f14a39862da031e"
                    versus="0x7bb6318685092bc9d5dad0e0562e260f524f51e13ab38ba9e6dc6b95f22a474c"></binary-pattern>
